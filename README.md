# Shared Library Downloader for Plex

# [Chrome Store Download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shared-library-downloader/jdlidamgkbjkdogfgelbkkmdaehmeglp?hl=en)

This Chrome extension creates a download button on media pages within plex to enable non-media-owners to download files.

This extension only works on video files, not music or other media, although the download button does also appear on non-downloadable files.

This extension is essentially a wrapper around Pip Longrun's <pip.longrun@protonmail.com> [Plex Downloader](https://piplong.run/plxdwnld), which is MIT licensed.
